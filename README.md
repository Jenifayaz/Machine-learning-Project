# Machine-learning-Project
Classifying whether the customers suffered for paying their energy bills during the last few  months or not.


Data: 
The training data includes 21 features with 1000 observations and a known label column named Class, 
where the value TRUE in the data means” Yes, they suffered from the increasing energy prices” and 
FALSE means “No they didn’t suffer”.
This is a Binary Classification problem representing with one of two classes. This training data has 
been trained for binary classifier to predict whether or not the customers suffer when there is increase 
in the energy prices.
Different steps involved in the problem are,
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Model Building
3.Comparison of the Models
4. Building Pipeline of the best Model
5.Testing the build model


PREDICTIVE TASK ON BINARY CLASSIFICATION                                                                  
→Investigated the performance of several Machine Learning procedures to predict whether the customer is going to encounter difficulties in paying the (increasing!) electricity cost based on a few features (demographic, heating system power, habits, family composition, etc..).
→	Improved the performance of each model by Hyperparameter tuning and GridSearchCV.
→	Evaluated the model using Accuracy score and Confusion Matrix.
